# Blog Entry 01 /2226

Fuck the system.

Maybe its about time we did. Let’s fuck with it. Techno feudalism is lording over us, as capitalism starts to wain, tech lords in their castles mine your energy and your souls. Stressed, anxious, addicted, they prey on you for their own ends. To what? Make money? Sell stuff. What a load of shit.

Lets turn the system on itself. In this techno-feudal world, pay attention to the only thing that matters. Your self. A better you = a better world. Feel helpless, do something about it. The only thing you have control over is —SHOCK — yourself. Start there. Live your life for you. 

Know what I see. The chance for adventure. AI will automate everything, there won’t be jobs. You won’t have to work. “What about purpose” you cry. You worry about purpose without a job. Boo-hoo. Are you that weak that a job is the only thing that gives you meaning? Give your self meaning. Get out there, discover, travel. 

Freedom is staring at us in the face. What are you gonna do with it. Continue to scroll on your phone? Pathetic. Get a life. Actually—you’ve got one. Do something. Actually do something with more than just your thumb staring cross eyed at a piece of glass blaring light at you. The phone is your master. You are chained and controlled by it. By those that control it. Whose your daddy? Mark Zuckerberg? You’re gonna let that guy control you, let the algorithm control you? Just stop. Turn it off. If you’d rather be addicted to techno-dick. Suck away.

Or get off your knees and do something with yourself. Find yourself, find others, find things. Discover your self. Actually live.

I’m going that way.
See you there.`
